          I'm a full stack web Developer currently working for
          <a class="underline" href="https://mirusresearch.com/"
            >Mirus Research</a
          >. I work on projects in Python with Django, Rust, Vue.js, alpine.js,
          handlebars.js, tailwindcss, and more. I by no means understand all of
          those languages and frameworks completely. I'm constantly learning new
          things in the world of web dev, and still have a long way to go. When
          I first started getting into programing, I thought I would grow to
          love UI and UX design because I love things that look really nice, and
          are well designed. I've since come to realize that I equeally love
          back end work, and making sure things are running smoothly under the
          hood.

          I'm a BloNo native and have lived here my whole life. I'm 23 years
          old, and married my wife Regan in November of 2024. I graduated from
          Illinois State University with a bachelor's degeree in Information
          Systems with an emphasis on web application development. When I'm not
          working, some of my hobbies & interests include:
          <ul class="pl-8 py-2 list-disc grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-4">
            <li>Playing Board Games</li>
            <li>Camping & Hiking</li>
            <li>Eating Great Food</li>
            <li>Thrifting</li>
            <li>College Basketball</li>
            <li>Chicago sports (sadly)</li>
            <li>Film Photography</li>
          </ul>
          My parents took me to
          <a class="underline" href="https://eastview.church/"
            >Eastview Christian Church</a
          >
          when I was a kid, and I've been attending ever since. The power of the
          gospel is life changing, and I have learned so much by studying the
          bible and the life of Jesus. He loves you, and he wants to know you.
